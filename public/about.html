      <h1>A little about me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Maurice Powell.

        Four words to describe me are short, fast, playful, and honest.
        
        My family members are Shyli, Grace, Sky, Megan, and Joey.
        
        A few of my favorite sports and games are skating, gymnastics, and ping pong.
        
        Let me tell you about pets: I have 3 dogs, 1 cat, and a lizard.
        
        Three things that make me happy are: sleeping late, eating ice cream, and no homework.
        
        My favorite subjects are art, robotics, dance, and math.
        
        My favorite fun places I like to go are Disneyland, the beach, and grandma's house.
        
        I like to eat cheeze pizza, macaroni and cheese, and cheesy nachos.
        
        Something fun not many people know about me is I can train my dog to do tricks. Source: https://oakdome.com/k5/lesson-plans/word/all-about-me-fun-facts-generator.php </p> <!-- Source: https://oakdome.com/k5/lesson-plans/word/all-about-me-fun-facts-generator.php -->
